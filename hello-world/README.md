# Hello World Function

This is a simple function that returns a "Hello, World!" message.

Navigate to the function in the browser, you should see a basic "Hello, World!" page.

Send a POST request to the function, and you will get a response that looks like this:
```json
{
    "message": "Hello, World!"
}
```

The function also logs 'Hello, World' to the console.
